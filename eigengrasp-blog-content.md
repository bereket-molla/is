# One Dial, Many Joints: Why Linear Works for a Pinch

## The moment this clicked in Robot Learning

It was a Thursday afternoon in Matei Ciocarlie's Robot Learning class at Columbia when he introduced EigenGrasps. The concept seemed almost too simple to be revolutionary: take a robotic hand with twenty-something joints, collect a bunch of grasp examples, run PCA on the joint angles, and suddenly you can control the entire hand with just two or three parameters. The math was undergraduate-level linear algebra, nothing fancy. Yet companies were using this to control million-dollar robotic hands in warehouses and labs worldwide.

I remember sitting there, watching the demo videos of complex hands smoothly transitioning between grasps using just a couple of "synergy dials," and feeling both impressed and deeply unsatisfied. The results were undeniable—the hands moved naturally, grasped objects reliably, and the dimensionality reduction was dramatic. But the nagging question that formed in my mind was: why should this work at all? Why should something as complex as grasping, with all its nonlinear kinematics and contact constraints, bow down to simple linear dimensionality reduction?

That evening, I dove into the original Santello paper from 1998, then Ciocarlie and Allen's work from 2009. The experimental results were even more impressive than what we'd seen in class. They showed that human hand postures during grasping could be captured with just 2-3 principal components accounting for over 80% of the variance. Robotic hands designed with these synergies built into their hardware could achieve complex grasps with simple control. But nowhere did I find a satisfying answer to my question: what is it about the physics and geometry of grasping that makes linear approximations so unreasonably effective?

This blog is my attempt to answer that question. We're going to build up from first principles, using the simplest possible example—a two-finger pinch—to understand why the physics of grasping creates natural low-dimensional structure that PCA can discover. We'll see that it's not a coincidence or a lucky break; the constraints of maintaining contact literally force the hand's configuration space to locally collapse to a one-dimensional manifold. Linear models aren't just convenient; they're geometrically natural for grasping, at least locally.

## EigenGrasps: from many joints to a few synergies

Before we dive into the why, let's be crystal clear about what EigenGrasps actually does. Imagine you have a robotic hand with n joints. Each configuration of the hand is described by a vector **q** ∈ ℝⁿ containing all the joint angles. For a modern robotic hand, n might be 16, 20, or even more. That's a lot of numbers to coordinate if you want to grasp something.

The core observation behind EigenGrasps is empirical: when humans or robots grasp objects, they don't explore the full n-dimensional space of possible joint configurations. Instead, the joint angles are highly correlated. When your index finger bends to grasp a cup, your middle finger tends to bend in a related way. When your thumb moves to oppose your fingers, it does so in patterns that repeat across different grasps.

Here's how the EigenGrasp algorithm captures this structure. First, you collect a dataset of m grasp postures, perhaps by having a human teleoperator control the robot hand to grasp various objects, or by recording human hand configurations with a data glove. Each grasp gives you a vector **q**⁽ⁱ⁾ ∈ ℝⁿ. Stack these as rows in a data matrix X ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ and compute the mean posture **μ**. 

The magic happens when you compute the covariance matrix Σ = (1/m)Xᵀ X where X is now mean-centered. The eigenvectors of this covariance matrix, arranged by decreasing eigenvalue, are the eigen-grasps. The first eigenvector captures the direction of maximum variance in your grasp data—the most common pattern of coordinated joint movement. The second eigenvector, orthogonal to the first, captures the next most significant pattern, and so on.

What makes this powerful is that typically, the first k eigenvectors (where k is small, like 2-4) capture most of the variance in the data. This means you can approximate any grasp in your dataset reasonably well using just a few coefficients. Instead of controlling n joints independently, you control k "synergy dials" that move all the joints in coordinated patterns.

The encoding is straightforward: given a posture **q**, you project it onto the eigen-grasp subspace to get coefficients **z** = Uᵀ(**q** - **μ**), where U ∈ ℝⁿˣᵏ contains the top k eigenvectors as columns. To generate a new grasp, you decode: **q̂** = **μ** + U**z**. By varying the k-dimensional **z**, you explore a k-dimensional subspace of the full n-dimensional configuration space—but it's the "right" subspace, the one where actual grasps live.

## What is a grasp, really?

To understand why linear models work so well for grasping, we need to be precise about what constitutes a grasp. It's tempting to think of a grasp as just "fingers touching an object," but that's like saying chess is just "pieces on a board." The constraints that define a valid grasp are what create the geometric structure that PCA exploits.

A grasp is fundamentally about constraints—kinematic and force constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied. Let's start with the kinematic side, which is what we'll focus on primarily (force constraints add another layer but don't change the fundamental geometry we're interested in).

For kinematic constraints, the story begins with contact. Each fingertip that's part of the grasp must maintain contact with the object. This sounds simple but think about what it means mathematically. If your fingertip is at position **p**ᵢ(q) (a function of joint angles **q**) and it's touching a point on the object surface, then as the joints move slightly, the fingertip must move in a way that keeps it on that surface.

There are two main flavors of contact that matter for our story. First is "stick contact" where the fingertip maintains contact with the same physical point on the object—imagine pressing your finger on a specific dot drawn on a ball and keeping it there as you adjust your grasp. Second is "sliding contact" where the fingertip can slide along the object surface but must remain in contact—like pinching a card and allowing your fingers to slide along its edge.

These contact requirements translate into mathematical constraints. If we write h(**q**) = 0 to represent all our contact constraints (where h is a vector-valued function), then maintaining the grasp means staying on the constraint manifold defined by this equation. When we make small changes δ**q** to our joint configuration, the linearized constraint becomes Jₕ(**q***)δ**q** = 0, where Jₕ is the Jacobian of h evaluated at some configuration **q***.

Here's the key insight that will drive everything that follows: the set of joint velocities δ**q** that maintain the grasp constraints forms a linear subspace—the nullspace of Jₕ. This nullspace typically has much lower dimension than n. For our two-finger pinch, we'll see that it's one-dimensional, meaning there's essentially only one independent way to move while maintaining the pinch.

The force constraints add another layer of richness. Contact forces must lie within friction cones (you can't push sideways harder than friction allows). The net wrench (force and torque) on the object must equal what's needed for the task—often zero for a stable grasp. And there's the beautiful fact that you can have internal forces (squeezing harder) that don't create any net object motion—these live in the nullspace of the grasp matrix.

But here's what's remarkable: for many common grasp types, the kinematic constraints alone create strong geometric structure. The force constraints often select particular regions within this structure but don't fundamentally change its local dimensionality.

## The simple, honest setting: two fingers, four joints

To really understand what's happening geometrically, let's work with the simplest non-trivial example: two fingers in a plane, each with two joints, pinching a thin object like a business card. This gives us four joint angles total: **q** = [q₁, q₂, q₃, q₄]ᵀ.

Picture this setup clearly. On the left, we have a two-link planar finger. The first joint (q₁) rotates the proximal link, and the second joint (q₂) rotates the distal link relative to the proximal. The fingertip position **p**_L depends on both angles through the forward kinematics—basic trigonometry that robot arms students learn in week two. On the right, we have a mirror image: another two-link finger with joints q₃ and q₄, producing fingertip position **p**_R.

Between them sits our object—let's say it's a thin card that we're pinching edge-on. The card can translate and rotate in the plane, but for now, let's assume it's fixed in space (we'll relax this later). Our task is to maintain a pinch grasp: both fingertips touching the card from opposite sides.

The Jacobians J_L and J_R are 2×2 matrices that map joint velocities to fingertip velocities. If you move joints q₁ and q₂ with velocities δq₁ and δq₂, the left fingertip moves with velocity J_L [δq₁, δq₂]ᵀ. These Jacobians depend on the current configuration—they change as the arm moves—but at any fixed configuration, they're just linear maps.

This setting is rich enough to demonstrate everything we need. We have enough degrees of freedom to see nontrivial constraint geometry, but it's simple enough to visualize and compute everything explicitly. Most importantly, it's a real grasp scenario that captures the essence of more complex multi-fingered grasping.

## Defining "pinch" with mathematical precision

Now we come to the heart of the matter: what exactly is a pinch, and what constraints does it impose on our four joint angles? We'll analyze two versions—stick and slide—and see that both lead to the same fundamental conclusion: maintaining a pinch reduces our four-dimensional configuration space to a one-dimensional curve.

Let's start with the "stick" version of a pinch. Here, each fingertip maintains contact with a specific point on the card. Imagine you've drawn dots on both sides of the card where your fingers touch, and your goal is to keep touching those exact dots. Additionally, for a proper pinch, the contact forces should be opposed—pushing directly against each other through the card.

For the stick constraint, both fingertips must maintain their position in space (since the card and the contact points are fixed). But that's not quite right—they can move, but they must move together. If the left fingertip moves by some tiny displacement δ**p**_L, the right fingertip must move by exactly the same displacement δ**p**_R = δ**p**_L to maintain contact with their respective fixed points on the fixed card.

Using our Jacobians, we can express this in terms of joint velocities. The left fingertip velocity is J_L[δq₁, δq₂]ᵀ and the right fingertip velocity is J_R[δq₃, δq₄]ᵀ. The constraint that they move together gives us:

J_L[δq₁, δq₂]ᵀ = J_R[δq₃, δq₄]ᵀ

This is two equations (one for each component of the 2D velocity) relating our four joint velocities.

But we also need the forces to be opposed. For our planar fingers, if we assume the distal links point roughly toward each other, the opposition constraint means the distal links should rotate in opposite directions. Since the distal link angles are q₁ + q₂ for the left and q₃ + q₄ for the right, maintaining opposition means:

δ(q₁ + q₂) + δ(q₃ + q₄) = 0

or simply: δq₁ + δq₂ + δq₃ + δq₄ = 0

That's one more equation. In total, we have three linear equations constraining our four joint velocities. We can write this as A δ**q** = 0 where A is a 3×4 matrix and δ**q** = [δq₁, δq₂, δq₃, δq₄]ᵀ.

## Why a pinch is "one dial": the intuition, then the math

Here's where the magic happens, and it's worth pausing to feel it intuitively before we crunch through the linear algebra. You're holding a pinch—thumb and finger pressed against a card. Now try to maintain that pinch while moving your hand. You'll notice something remarkable: there's essentially only one independent thing you can vary. You can "pinch more" or "pinch less," changing the pressure and slightly adjusting the configuration, but all your joints move in coordinated patterns. It feels like you're turning a single dial that controls the entire grasp.

This isn't just a quirk of human motor control—it's forced by the physics. The constraints of maintaining contact and opposition are so restrictive that they eliminate most of your degrees of freedom. Let's see exactly how this happens mathematically.

We have the constraint A δ**q** = 0 where A is 3×4. Generically (meaning, except for special configurations like singularities), this matrix has rank 3. The nullspace of a 3×4 matrix with rank 3 is one-dimensional. This means there's only one independent direction in joint space along which we can move while maintaining all our constraints.

Let's call this special direction **n** ∈ ℝ⁴. Any allowed instantaneous motion must be of the form δ**q** = α**n** for some scalar α. The vector **n** tells us the ratios in which all joints must move. If n = [0.5, 0.3, -0.4, -0.4]ᵀ, for example, then whenever joint 1 moves by 0.5 radians, joint 2 must simultaneously move by 0.3 radians, joint 3 by -0.4 radians, and joint 4 by -0.4 radians.

This is our "one dial"—the scalar α. Turning it positive moves all joints in the ratios specified by **n**. Turning it negative reverses all motions. But you can't move joints independently; they're locked into this coordinated pattern by the constraints of maintaining the pinch.

Now let's consider the "slide" version of pinch. Here, the fingertips can slide along the card's edge while maintaining contact. Picture pinching a card and sliding your fingers along its edge—the pinch point moves, but you maintain contact and opposition throughout.

The mathematics changes slightly but leads to the same dimensionality conclusion. Now both fingertips must move along the same direction—the tangent to the card's edge. If the local tangent direction is **t** and the fingertips slide by a small distance δs along the edge, then:

J_L[δq₁, δq₂]ᵀ = **t** δs
J_R[δq₃, δq₄]ᵀ = **t** δs

Combined with the opposition constraint, we can solve for δ**q** in terms of δs. The solution has the form δ**q** = **N** δs for some vector **N** ∈ ℝ⁴. Again, we have one independent parameter (now it's literally the slide distance δs) controlling all four joints in fixed ratios.

## From velocities to positions: why local linearity emerges

So far, we've been talking about instantaneous velocities—which directions we can move from a given configuration. But what about actual positions? If we start from some pinch configuration **q*** and want to find all nearby configurations that also form valid pinches, what does that set look like?

This is where we transition from differential constraints to finite displacements, and where the beautiful structure emerges. The set of all configurations that maintain our pinch constraints forms a smooth curve through the 4D configuration space. Mathematically, this is a 1-dimensional manifold embedded in ℝ⁴.

Near any particular configuration **q***, we can parameterize this curve using a single parameter z. Taylor expanding around **q***, the curve looks like:

**q**(z) = **q*** + **n**z + (1/2)**w**z² + O(z³)

where **n** is our nullspace direction (the tangent to the curve) and **w** captures the curvature.

Here's the crucial observation: the linear term dominates for small z. The curvature term **w**z² only becomes significant when z gets large enough that z² is comparable to z. This means that locally—in a neighborhood around any pinch configuration—the constraint manifold is approximately a straight line.

This is why PCA works so well! If you collect data from pinch grasps near a configuration **q***, varying the grasp slightly (small z values), your data points will lie approximately along a line in the direction **n**. The nonlinearity (curvature) only shows up as small perpendicular deviations that grow quadratically with distance from **q***.

Think about what this means practically. If you're controlling a pinch grasp and making small adjustments—exactly what you do during fine manipulation—the relationship between your control parameter and joint angles is nearly linear. The physics has handed us a gift: complex nonlinear constraints produce locally linear behavior.

## How this manifests in real data

If you actually collected joint angle data from repeated pinch grasps and made pairwise plots (q₁ vs q₂, q₁ vs q₃, etc.), you'd see something striking: nearly straight lines. The slopes of these lines are determined by the ratios in the nullspace vector **n**.

For instance, if n₁/n₂ = 1.5, then the plot of q₁ versus q₂ would show a line with slope approximately 1.5. Small deviations from the line come from the curvature term and measurement noise, but the linear trend dominates.

In the full 4D space, your data forms what I like to call a "thin cigar"—an elongated cloud that's much longer in one direction (along **n**) than in any perpendicular direction. This is exactly the structure that PCA is designed to find. The first principal component will align with the long axis of the cigar, recovering the physically meaningful synergy direction **n**.

This isn't a coincidence or luck. PCA is solving the optimization problem of finding the best linear subspace to approximate your data in a least-squares sense. The physics of grasping has created data that lives near a linear subspace (at least locally), so PCA's solution aligns with the physical constraint structure.

## What PCA is actually optimizing (and why it works here)

Let's be precise about what PCA does and why it's so well-matched to our grasp data. PCA solves an optimization problem that can be stated in two equivalent ways.

The reconstruction view asks: what k-dimensional linear subspace minimizes the sum of squared distances from data points to their projections onto the subspace? Mathematically, we're looking for an orthonormal matrix U ∈ ℝⁿˣᵏ that minimizes:

Σᵢ ||**x**⁽ⁱ⁾ - UUᵀ**x**⁽ⁱ⁾||²

The variance view asks: what k orthogonal directions capture the most variance in the data? We want U that maximizes:

tr(Uᵀ Σ U)

where Σ is the data covariance matrix.

These two problems have the same solution: U should contain the top k eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. For k=1 (finding the best line), PCA finds the direction of maximum variance, which minimizes perpendicular distances to the line.

Now here's why this works so well for our pinch data. Each data point (centered) can be written as:

**q̃**⁽ⁱ⁾ ≈ **n** zᵢ + **ρ**ᵢ

where **n** is the true constraint tangent, zᵢ is how far along the constraint manifold this grasp is, and **ρ**ᵢ represents the small perpendicular deviation due to curvature (scaling as zᵢ²).

The covariance matrix becomes:

Σ ≈ Var(z) **n****n**ᵀ + E[**ρρ**ᵀ]

Since the perpendicular deviations **ρ** are small (quadratic in z), the first term dominates. The top eigenvector of Σ is approximately **n**, aligned with the true physical constraint direction. PCA automatically discovers the synergy that physics imposes.

The approximation quality depends on the range of z in your data. Over a range |z| ≤ Δ, the curvature contributes errors of order Δ². The RMS reconstruction error scales as:

RMS error ≈ (1/2)||**w**||Δ²

This quadratic growth is the price we pay for using a linear model on intrinsically curved data. But for small enough Δ (local data), the error can be negligible.

## Where linearity breaks: curvature, modes, and limits

Understanding where linear models succeed naturally leads us to understand where they fail. The beauty is that the same geometric framework tells us exactly when and why PCA will struggle.

First and most obvious is curvature over extended ranges. As we move farther from our reference configuration **q***, the quadratic term (1/2)**w**z² becomes significant. The true constraint manifold bends away from the linear approximation. If you collect pinch data over a wide range—from barely touching to squeezing hard—the curvature becomes unavoidable. PCA will find some average line through the curved data, but the perpendicular errors grow.

More subtle is the multi-mode problem. "Pinch" isn't a single grasp—it's a family. You have precision pinches with fingertips, power pinches with more finger surface, pinches at different angles. Each variant has its own constraint manifold with its own tangent direction. If you collect data mixing these modes, PCA sees a cloud that's not cigar-shaped but more like multiple cigars at different angles. The first PC tries to find some average direction, which might not align with any actual physical synergy.

Joint limits introduce another form of nonlinearity. As you approach the limit of how far a joint can bend, the synergy pattern must change—you can't keep moving in the direction **n** if one component would violate a joint limit. The constraint manifold "bends" to respect these limits, creating curvature that's not smooth but sharp.

Then there's the metric mismatch issue. PCA uses Euclidean distance in joint space, treating all joints equally. But for task performance, some joint configurations might be far more important than others. A small error in fingertip position might matter more than a large error in proximal joint angles. Using the wrong metric means PCA might find the mathematically optimal subspace but not the task-relevant one.

Finally, there's the global topology problem. We've been studying local geometry—the shape of the constraint manifold near a point. But globally, grasp manifolds can have complex topology. The set of all ways to grasp a sphere forms a high-dimensional manifold with interesting global structure that no linear model can capture.

## Why the pinch tells us everything: other grasps follow the same geometric rules

Before we revisit EigenGrasps with our newfound understanding, let's address why we spent so much time on the humble pinch. It might seem like we've analyzed a special case—too simple to generalize. But here's the beautiful truth: every grasp type, from power grasps to precision tripods to complex whole-hand manipulations, follows the same geometric principles. The pinch is just the clearest window into this universal structure.

Let's see how this plays out for other common grasp types. Take the power grasp—wrapping your fingers around a cylinder like a hammer handle. At first glance, this seems far more complex than a pinch. You have multiple fingers, each with multiple joints, all making contact with the object at different points. The configuration space might be 12- or 16-dimensional for a full robotic hand.

But watch what happens when we apply our constraint analysis. For a stable power grasp around a cylinder, each finger must maintain contact with the cylindrical surface. If finger i has its tip at position **p**ᵢ(**q**), the contact constraint is:

||**p**ᵢ(**q**) - **c**|| = r

where **c** is the cylinder's axis position and r is its radius. That's one constraint per fingertip.

Additionally, for a secure grasp, the fingers need to be distributed around the cylinder—you can't have all fingers on one side. This adds angular constraints. And to maintain stable contact, each finger's approach angle must be roughly normal to the surface, adding more constraints.

Here's the key insight: just as with the pinch, these constraints drastically reduce the dimensionality of valid motions. If you have a 16-DOF hand making a power grasp with 4 fingers contacting a cylinder, you might have 12-14 constraints (depending on contact types and force requirements). This leaves you with only 2-4 independent degrees of freedom—remarkably close to what we found with the pinch.

What are these remaining degrees of freedom? Typically, they correspond to intuitive "synergies": you can "squeeze harder" (moving all fingers radially inward while maintaining contact), you can "slide along" the cylinder (if sliding contact is allowed), or you can "adjust the spread" (changing how the fingers are distributed angularly). Each of these is a one-dimensional family of motions, just like our pinch was.

The tripod grasp—thumb opposing two fingers to pick up a small object—tells a similar story. Let's work through it. You have three contact points forming a triangle around the object. Each contact point contributes two position constraints (in 2D, or three in 3D). For stable grasping, the contact forces must:
- Point roughly toward the object's center (adds direction constraints)
- Balance to create zero net force (adds 2-3 equations)
- Balance to create zero net torque (adds 1-3 equations depending on dimensionality)

Count them up: for a planar tripod with 6-8 joint angles involved, you typically get 5-6 constraints, leaving 1-2 degrees of freedom. Again, we've collapsed a high-dimensional space to something manageable. The remaining DOFs correspond to "pinch harder" and perhaps "rotate the grasp" if the object geometry allows.

Even more interesting is what happens with adaptive grasps—where the hand conforms to an unknown object shape. Consider grasping an irregular rock. You might think this breaks our analysis since you don't know the constraints in advance. But that's not quite right. The process of establishing the grasp—moving fingers until they make contact—is itself a constraint satisfaction process. Once contact is established, the same geometric principles apply: maintaining those contacts eliminates most degrees of freedom.

In fact, underactuated hands (where multiple joints are mechanically coupled to move together) are designed exactly to exploit this principle. The Robotiq gripper, the Yale OpenHand, the Pisa/IIT SoftHand—they all have fewer motors than joints, relying on mechanical coupling to automatically satisfy contact constraints. They're building the constraint-induced dimensionality reduction directly into the hardware!

Let me show you something beautiful about the mathematical structure that emerges. For any grasp type, we can write the general form of the instantaneous kinematic constraints:

J_contact δ**q** = δ**x**_object
G δ**f** = δ**w**_object

where J_contact maps joint velocities to contact point velocities, G is the grasp matrix mapping contact forces to object wrench, δ**x**_object describes allowed object motion (zero for fixed objects), and δ**w**_object is the desired object wrench change.

The key observation is that the nullspace dimension of J_contact is typically small—usually 1-3 for stable grasps. This is true whether you're analyzing a pinch, a power grasp, or anything in between. The physics of maintaining contact while controlling an object simply doesn't leave much room for independent variations.

This universality explains why EigenGrasps work across different grasp types. When Santello collected human grasp data across various objects and tasks, he wasn't just capturing pinches or just power grasps—he was sampling from multiple grasp families. Yet 2-3 principal components captured most of the variance. Why? Because each grasp family contributes a low-dimensional manifold (1-3 dimensions typically) to the overall configuration space. Even multiple grasp types together create a relatively low-dimensional structure that PCA can approximate.

The pattern is so robust that you can predict it without collecting data. Given a hand design and a grasp type, you can:
1. Write down the contact constraints
2. Compute the constraint Jacobian
3. Find its nullspace dimension
4. Predict how many synergies will dominate

This isn't just theoretical. In my own experiments with a 12-DOF hand model, I found:
- Precision pinch: 1 dominant synergy (plus small secondary)
- Power grasp on cylinder: 2 dominant synergies
- Tripod on sphere: 2 dominant synergies
- Flat hand pressing: 1 dominant synergy

The numbers match what the constraint analysis predicts. The physics determines the geometry, and the geometry determines what PCA will find.

There's a deeper message here about modularity in motor control. The nervous system doesn't need to solve a different problem for each grasp type. The constraint structure provides a common framework—reduce dimensionality by projecting onto the constraint nullspace, then control within that reduced space. Whether you're pinching a business card or grasping a hammer, you're navigating a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space of all possible hand configurations.

This is why studying the pinch in detail was worthwhile. It's not just one grasp among many—it's the simplest clear example of a universal principle. Once you understand why a pinch is one-dimensional, you have the tools to understand why any grasp is low-dimensional. The mathematics might get messier with more fingers and contacts, but the geometric intuition remains exactly the same: constraints kill dimensions, and grasping is all about constraints.

## EigenGrasps revisited: why they work, with nuance

With our geometric understanding in place, we can now give a complete answer to why EigenGrasps work so well in practice, along with the caveats.

The success of EigenGrasps rests on a beautiful alignment between the physics of grasping and the mathematics of PCA. Grasp constraints create low-dimensional manifolds in configuration space. Locally, these manifolds are nearly linear. PCA finds the best linear approximation to data. When your grasp data comes from a local region of a grasp family, PCA recovers the physically meaningful synergies.

This explains the empirical observations. Human hand data shows 2-3 principal components capturing 80%+ of variance because many grasps are variations on a few constraint patterns (pinch, power grasp, tripod, etc.), and data often comes from local regions of these patterns. Robotic hands designed with synergies built into their mechanics work well because they're mechanically constrained to move along physically relevant directions.

But our analysis also reveals the limitations. EigenGrasps work best for:
- Local regions of grasp families (small variations around a nominal grasp)
- Single-mode grasping (not mixing fundamentally different grasp types)
- Tasks where Euclidean distance in joint space correlates with task performance
- Hands without strong joint coupling or limits (or data that avoids these regions)

When you need to cover large ranges, multiple modes, or respect complex constraints, linear methods show their limits. The errors aren't just numerical—they're geometric, coming from trying to approximate curved manifolds with flat subspaces.

This leads naturally to the question: can we do better? Can we find the curved, one-dimensional manifold that the physics actually creates, rather than its linear approximation? This is where nonlinear dimensionality reduction comes in—kernel PCA, autoencoders, and other methods that can capture curved structure. But that's a story for another day.

## The deeper lesson: physics creates structure

Stepping back from the technical details, there's a profound lesson here about the relationship between physics and learning. The success of EigenGrasps isn't because PCA is magical or because we got lucky. It's because the physics of grasping creates strong geometric structure in configuration space, and PCA is well-matched to find that structure (at least locally).

This pattern appears throughout robotics and control. Walking creates limit cycles—closed curves in state space. Reaching creates geodesics—shortest paths under the motor control metric. Balance creates invariant manifolds—surfaces that dynamics preserve. In each case, the physics creates lower-dimensional structure embedded in high-dimensional spaces.

The art of robot learning is often about finding the right representation to expose this structure. Sometimes, as with EigenGrasps, simple linear methods suffice. Sometimes you need nonlinear methods to capture curvature. Sometimes you need dynamics-aware methods that respect time evolution. But in all cases, you're not imposing structure arbitrarily—you're discovering structure that physics put there.

Understanding this changes how we approach problems. Instead of asking "what algorithm should I use?", we ask "what structure does the physics create?" Instead of treating robot learning as pure machine learning, we recognize it as a dialogue between computation and mechanics, between algorithms and physics.

The next time you see a complex robotic system being controlled with surprisingly few parameters, remember the lesson of the pinch: sometimes the physics does most of the work for us. Our job is just to discover what it's already created.
